You'll notice that there are three entries for British Columbia with the same information. 

In the **Contents** pane on the left, there are four layers associated with the data we added from the Living Atlas. 

Uncheck the blue checkmarks next to every layer except the layer representing **Deaths**. You'll see that this layer is depicted using the symbol of a black X.

Click on the first layer in the **Contents** pane to explore the data and the tools associated with each layer.
