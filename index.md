# Intro to ArcGIS Online and Story Maps

### **Goals**
This workshop introduces complete beginners to the [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html) platform and tools. This workshop is intended for those unfamiliar with GIS software or code but who want to create a map and add it to a Story Map or incorporate simple spatial analysis into their work. By the end of this workshop participants will be able to:

  - Discover and explore available geospatial data online
  - Add data to a map 
  - Symbolize data
  - Configure pop-ups
  - Embed a map in a Story Map
  - Add photos and text to a Story Map

### **Setup**
You will need to sign up for a free ArcGIS public [account](https://www.arcgis.com/home/signin.html) ahead of time. If you already have an account with Esri, you can choose to use your regular sign in or create a separate free account.

Click **Create an account**.

Under Create a free public account, click **Create an ArcGIS Public Account** and follow the instructions.

You will also need to download data. Click on the 'Download Data' button below to start the download. Once complete, extract the contents of the .zip file. This data comes from the [City of Vancouver](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/census-local-area-profiles-2016/information/). For this workshop, we will download a CSV file of 2016 Census data for Vancouver.
