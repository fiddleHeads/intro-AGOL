# Create a Story Map

Some of you have probably already seen examples of [Story Maps](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-storymaps/stories).

Anyone with an ArcGIS Online account can create one, and they are a good way to tell a story with maps, pictures, videos, and text.

They can be used as a presentation tool in place of PowerPoint, especially if you want to incorporate maps or embedded interactive content.

In this section, we'll add the web map we created to a Story Map and practice adding other content as well.

There are a couple different ways to create a Story Map.

To start from scratch, go to https://storymaps.arcgis.com/ and click on **New Story.**

For this workshop, we'll use a different method.

To Do {: .label .label-green }
From the top left of your web map, click on the **Home** dropdown arrow and select **Content.**

Click on the web map you created and just exited.

This will take you to the **Overview** page.

On the far right, from the **Create Web App** dropdown, select **StoryMaps.**

This will take you to a template with your web map already embedded.

Add a title and a subtitle.

You can click on the **Add image or video** to upload a file from your computer to be used as the backdrop for the title.

Scrolling down, you'll see your interactive web map. The popups will work as you configured them.

Let's add some context before the web map.

Above the web map, click on the + sign to see the options.

Choose to add a **Heading.**

You might ask a question in the heading, such as **Did you know that some homeless shelters accept pets?**

Because the Story Map template provides such an easy way to add different kinds of content, spend the rest of the time experimenting with contextualizing the web map you created. 

You can do a Google Image search to find images to add.

You might want to talk about or link to the article in [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/people-in-abusive-relationships-face-many-barriers-to-leaving-pets-should-not-be-one-139540?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Latest%20from%20The%20Conversation%20for%20June%2017%202020&utm_content=Latest%20from%20The%20Conversation%20for%20June%2017%202020+CID_e7708191b09d4919198c361914f475ff&utm_source=campaign_monitor_ca&utm_term=pets%20should%20not%20be%20one) which discusses how the prospect of leaving a pet behind makes it more difficult for people in abusive relationships to leave their abusers. 

You can change the style of your Story Map in a certain section by choosing to add a different template.

You can also change some aspects of the design of your Story Map by clicking the **Design** button at the top right of the page.

When you're done configuring your Story Map, click on **Preview** to see what it will look like outside of edit mode.

By clicking **Publish**, you can choose to share your Story Map with your organization if your Esri account is linked to one or with the public.
