## CHANGE THE BASEMAP

The **Topographic** layer represents the default basemap whenever you open a web map in AGOL. Let's change the basemap to something that looks better with the COVID-19 data.

To Do 
{: .label .label-green }
From the upper left, click on **Basemap** and select the **Light Gray Canvas**.
Click on the **Save** dropdown arrow in the ribbon above the map and select **Save**.
You will need to give the map a title, add tags to make it discoverable later, and a summary.

Call your map **COVID-19 Cases**

Add these tags: COVID-19, Canada

Summary: Map created as part of Intro to AGOL workshop.

Next let's explore different ways of discovering the underlying data.
